    (imp) perlmonks thread that prompted me to get this packaged up
http://use.perl.org/~mr_bean/journal/30174 
    (mr_bean) encouraging journal entry
http://ctags.sourceforge.net/FORMAT
    (via wolverian) "mainly, the function tag for variables would be nice"
    (add sigils?  iskeyword+=@-@)
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vim/message/68815
    (ml thread on vim@vim.org, really about perlcomplete, but me and [dm]r_bean appear to have hijacked it to talk Perl::Tags)

Add a function param to variables and the necessary magic to infer what
function a variable is in.

Figure out if can use sigils in tag name

01:44 < wolverian> anyway, try removing the ^ in to_string, if you want.
    (to make tags jump to statement instead of line)

    But check that this doesn't cause weird shit upstream!

    -- committed, revert if causes problems
        - wolv

work out release for P::T::PPI

Do testing with VIM
Make the repo public :-)
    05_vim.t
    (doesn't work in make test/prove, because the output is redirected and vim whines)

02:52 < Alias> Are you compatible with the ctag command line params?
02:53 < Alias> Because Ultraedit DOES seem to have support for integrating it
02:53 < Alias> Which means PPI-based ctags on Win32
02:53 < Alias> shiny
02:53 < osfameron> there isn't a frontend for Perl::Tags yet
02:53 -!- Averell [averell@i577B4166.versanet.de] has joined #perl
02:53 < osfameron> it's basically refactored from pltags.pl which comes distributed with vim
02:53 < Alias> ok
02:53 < osfameron> but I guess it wouldn't be hard to write a frontend with a ctags-like interface
02:53 < Alias> Well then just so you know, we need one :)
02:53 < Alias> Even if it's a simple one

Make the repo public :-)
    done - Alias/Wolverian

Make frontend supporting at least "-L %fi -f %fo" for UltraEdit (Alias)
